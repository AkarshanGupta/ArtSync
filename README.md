* Diverse Style Options:Curate a diverse collection of artistic styles, ranging from classic paintings to contemporary trends, catering to a wide range of user preferences.

# Technology 
This website leverages the following technologies for neural style transfer: Streamlit for the user interface, PyTorch for deep learning, and Streamlit for streamlined web development.
The codebase is written in Python and executed using PyCharm as the integrated development environment (IDE). 
The minimal tech stack includes Python, Streamlit, PyTorch providing a robust foundation for a creative and interactive neural style transfer experience.

# Thoughts 
* This a image styler where one input the image/picture and select the style by selecting the reference photo and style it.
  After clicking the stylize button we get the desired **styled** image. It have download button also which download the stylized image.
* The image also get saved in the **output-image** after hitting the stylize button , one can change this code by editting the code the style.py 
  and main.py, Intially the main.py conatins the frontend part how the website structure will look like you can edit the code and add a option where you can upload the image.
* While making of this project one can understand how the pytorch library is being used and how the training and eval part is done.
